Numa tigela misture a farinha de milho com o sal e
Regue com a água aos poucos, mexendo com uma colher para umedecer a farinha
a textura deve ficar como a de areia molhada bem úmida
Deixe hidratar por 10 minutos assim os flocos ficam mais macios ao cozinhar no vapor

Preencha o fundo da cuscuzeira com água e encaixe o cesto de vapor na panela
Transfira a farinha de milho hidratada para o cesto
sem compactar
Tampe e leve para cozinhar em fogo alto

Assim que começar a ferver vai sair um leve vapor pela lateral da tampa
Abaixe o fogo e deixe cozinhar por mais 10 minutos até o cuscuz ficar bem macio
Verifique ao abrir a tampa o cuscuz deve estar inflado macio ao toque

Desligue o fogo e com cuidado para não se queimar ou virar o cesto puxe a haste central para desenformar cuscuz Transfira para uma tigela e desfaça o cuscuz em pedaços com um garfo

Numa tigela pequena misture a manteiga com um quarto de xícara chá da água fervente da cuscuzeira Mexa com uma colher até derreter pelo menos a metade da manteiga ela termina de derreter com o calor do cuscuz

If you ever leave me baby
Leave some morphine at my door
Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor (oh)
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain rain ra-a-a-ain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Uh your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh if I was in their shoes I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain rain ra-a-a-ain
Oh don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)
Don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right
Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain rain ra-a-a-ain

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh ooh ooh hoo
Mm too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh ooh ooh hoo
Mm too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

I'm a phoenix in the water
A fish that's learned to fly
And I've always been a daughter
But feathers are meant for the sky
So I'm wishing, wishing further
For the excitement to arrive
It's just I'd rather be causing the chaos
Than laying at the sharp end of this knife
With every small disaster
I'll let the waters still
Take me away to some place real
'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
It's where you go when you're alone
It's where you go to rest your bones
It's not just where you lay your head
It's not just where you make your bed
As long as we're together, does it matter where we go?
Home
Home
Home
Home
So when I'm ready to be bolder
And my cuts have healed with time
Comfort will rest on my shoulder
And I'll bury my future behind
I'll always keep you with me
You'll be always on my mind
But there's a shining in the shadows
I'll never know unless I try
With every small disaster
I'll let the waters still
Take me away to some place real
'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
It's where you go when you're alone
It's where you go to rest your bones
It's not just where you lay your head
It's not just where you make your bed
As long as we're together, does it matter where we go?
Home

Home, home, home, home
Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
It's where you go when you're alone
It's where you go to rest your bones
It's not just where you lay your head
It's not just where you make your bed
As long as we're together, does it matter where we go

Hey girl, open the walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
"Mom, please wake up
Dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis"
No one never listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh-oh, she's coming to the attic, plastic
Go back to being plastic
No one never listens
This wallpaper glistens
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E

Hey girl (hey girl)
Hey girl, open your walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
